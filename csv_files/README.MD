# This folder should contain all the individual CSV files for each trialâ€™s LSL-synced raw audio data. Each CSV needs to have two columns (one for global time in ms, one for amplitude).

# Usage: The notebook automatically iterates through all .CSV files in this folder to compute all trial start and end times.

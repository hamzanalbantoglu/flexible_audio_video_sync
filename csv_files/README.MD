This folder should contain all the individual CSV files for each trial's LSL-synced raw audio.

Each CSV needs to have two columns (one for global time in ms, one for amplitude).

**Usage**: The notebook automatically iterates through all CSV files in this folder to compute all the trial start and end times.
